                A youthful figure in the robe of a magician, having the countenance of divine Apollo, with smile of confidence and shining eyes. Above his head is the mysterious sign of the <strong>Holy Spirit</strong>, the sign of life, like an endless cord, forming the figure 8 in a horizontal position . About his waist is a <strong>serpent-cincture</strong>, the serpent appearing to devour its own tail. This is familiar to most as a conventional symbol of eternity, but here it indicates more especially the eternity of attainment in the spirit. In the Magician's right hand is a wand raised towards heaven, while the left hand is pointing to the earth. This dual sign is known in very high grades of the Instituted Mysteries; it shews the descent of grace, virtue and light, drawn from things above and derived to things below. The suggestion throughout is therefore the possession and communication of the Powers and Gifts of the Spirit. On the table in front of the Magician are the symbols of the four Tarot suits, signifying the elements of natural life, which lie like counters before the adept, and he adapts them as he wills. Beneath are roses and lilies, the <strong>flos campi and lilium convallium</strong>, changed into garden flowers, to shew the culture of aspiration. This card signifies the divine motive in man, reflecting God, the will in the liberation of its union with that which is above. It is also the unity of individual being on all planes, and in a very high sense it is thought, in the fixation thereof. With further reference to what I have called the sign of life and its connexion with the number 8, it may be remembered that Christian Gnosticism speaks of rebirth in Christ as a change "unto the Ogdoad." The mystic number is termed Jerusalem above, the Land flowing with Milk and Honey, the Holy Spirit and the Land of the Lord. According to Martinism, 8 is the number of Christ.

            <p>There is a lot to cover in this card. First I'll cover the symbols of infinity. We have a halo of sorts over the Magician's head. This symbol is a mathematical symbol, the lemiscate (infinity symbol), and is abstract - not of the flesh. The other symbol, the Orobouros (the snake symbol), wrapped around his waist. This is a snake that continues on forever by consuming itself. This painful process is flesh consuming flesh - it is an infinite hell.</p>
            <p>On the table beside the Magician are the symbols of the four suits in the Tarot deck. They represent the four classical elements: air, fire, water, and earth. These, in turn, symbolize our interactions with the day-to-day world. He has transformed these experiences into the wand he holds in his right hand - "he adapts them as he wills". This wand is seen again in the last card, <a href="ar21.html">XXI The Universe</a>, where the triumphant soul has accomplished the transformation internally and externally.</p>
            <p>Tying these two things together are the flowers at the top and bottom of the card. The white lilies represent death, and the red roses represent life. The magician points downward to the lilies and roses with his (fleshly) hand. This is life amongst death. This is the idea of being reincarnated in the flesh. Death leads into a new life in the flesh. With the wand, the syncretic object, he points towards the heavens where there are roses alone. This is life without death. This is the goal of "great work" of the occultists. They believed that life is eternal, but to get out of the life-death-life cycle, one has to work. There is no salvation by grace or faith alone.</p>
            <p>The two types of eternal life are reflected in the two different symbols for eternity. The lemiscate (infinity symbol) represents a self reinforcing process. All points are supported and driven on by their adjacent points. The Orobouros (snake symbol), however, represents an eternity of flesh supported only by consumption. This idea is shown as corrected on the card <a href="ar08.html">VIII Strength</a>, where there is only the lemiscate.</p>
